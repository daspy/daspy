! !ROUTINE: PDAF_estkf_AOmega --- Operate matrix Omega on A as AOmega
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_estkf_AOmega(dim, dim_ens, A)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Operate matrix Omega on another matrix as
!         $A = A Omega$.
!
! Omega is a dim_ens x (dim_ens-1) matrix with matximum
! rank and zero column sums. It is computed by the 
! Householder reflection associate with the vector
! (N-1)^(-1) (1,...,1)^T.
!
! The values of Omega are
!    1 - 1 / (N (1/sqrt(N) + 1)) for i=j
!    - 1 / (N (1/sqrt(N) + 1)) for i/=j, i<N
!    - 1 / sqrt(N) for i=N
!
! In this routine the product A Omega is implemented as
! operations:
! 1. Compute the row sums of A
! 2. Normalize row sums by 1/(sqrt(N) + N)
! 3. Subtract value of last column multiplied by 1/(1+sqrt(N))
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !

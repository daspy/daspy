! !ROUTINE: PDAF_incremental_si --- Interface for PDAF with incremental updating
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_incremental_si(steps)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Interface routine for PDAF with incremental
! analysis updating. It is called from the model 
! during the forecast. It has to provide the
! user-supplied routine U\_dist\_stateinc with
! the analysis increment from the analysis routine.
!
! This routine provides the simplified interface
! where names of user-provided subroutines are
! fixed. It simply calls the routine with the
! full interface using a pre-defined routine name.
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2010-07 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
!
! !USES:
  IMPLICIT NONE
  
! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: steps ! Time steps over which increment is distributed

! ! Names of external subroutines 
  EXTERNAL :: distribute_stateinc_pdaf  ! Add state increment during integration

! Called by: model code
! Calls: PDAF_incremental

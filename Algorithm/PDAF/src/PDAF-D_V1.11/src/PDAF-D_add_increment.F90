! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_add_increment(dim_p, state_p)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Interface routine for PDAF with incremental analysis updating. 
! The routine adds the full analysis increment to the given state vector .
! This is required, e.g. for the PREPOSTSTEP routines to test the
! analysis state before the next forecast.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !

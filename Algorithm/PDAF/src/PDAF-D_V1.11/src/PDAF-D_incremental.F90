! !ROUTINE: PDAF_incremental --- Interface for PDAF with incremental updating
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_incremental(steps, U_dist_stateinc)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Interface routine for PDAF with incremental
! analysis updating. It is called from the model 
! during the forecast. It has to provide the
! user-supplied routine U\_dist\_stateinc with
! the analysis increment from the analysis routine.
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2006-08 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
!
! !USES:
  USE PDAF_mod_filter, &
       ONLY: initevol, incremental, dim_p, state_inc
  USE PDAF_mod_filtermpi, &
       ONLY: mype

  IMPLICIT NONE
  
! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: steps ! Time steps over which increment is distributed

! ! External subroutines 
! ! (PDAF-internal names, real names are defined in the calling routine)
  EXTERNAL :: U_dist_stateinc  ! Add state increment during integration
  
! !CALLING SEQUENCE:
! Called by: model code
! Calls: U_dist_stateinc
!EOP

  END IF

! *** Call user routine to distribute and add increment ***

  IF (incremental == 1) THEN

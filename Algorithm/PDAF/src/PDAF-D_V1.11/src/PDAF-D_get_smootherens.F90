! !ROUTINE: PDAF_get_smootherens --- Set pointer to smoother ensemble
SUBROUTINE PDAF_get_smootherens(sens_point, maxlag, status)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Routine to set the pointer to the PDAF-internal smoother ensemble array.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2012-05 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
!
! !USES:
! Include definitions for real type of different precision
! (Defines BLAS/LAPACK routines and MPI_REALTYPE)
#include "typedefs.h"

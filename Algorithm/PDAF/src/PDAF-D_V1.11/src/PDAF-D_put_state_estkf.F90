! !ROUTINE: PDAF_put_state_estkf --- Interface to PDAF for ESTKF
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_put_state_estkf(U_collect_state, U_init_dim_obs, U_obs_op, &
     U_init_obs, U_prepoststep, U_prodRinvA, U_init_obsvar, outflag)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Interface routine called from the model after the 
! forecast of each ensemble state to transfer data
! from the model to PDAF.  For the parallelization 
! this involves transfer from model PEs to filter 
! PEs.\\
! During the forecast phase state vectors are 
! re-initialized from the forecast model fields
! by U\_collect\_state. 
! At the end of a forecast phase (i.e. when all 
! ensemble members have been integrated by the model)
! sub-ensembles are gathered from the model tasks.
! Subsequently the filter update is performed.
!
! The code is very generic. Basically the only
! filter-specific part if the call to the
! update-routine PDAF\_X\_update where the analysis
! is computed.  The filter-specific subroutines that
! are specified in the call to PDAF\_put\_state\_X
! are passed through to the update routine
!
! Variant for ESTKF with domain decomposition.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !

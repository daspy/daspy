! !ROUTINE: PDAF_smoother_shift --- Shift ensemble states in ensemble array for smoothing
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_smoother_shift(dim_p, dim_ens, dim_lag, ens_p, sens_p, cnt_maxlag, screen)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Routine to store a previous analysis ensemble for smoothing.
! The storage is performed by shifting all previous ensembles
! by one. Thus the previous ensembles are stored consecutively.
!
! Variant for domain decomposed states.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2012-05 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
!
! !USES:
! Include definitions for real type of different precision
! (Defines BLAS/LAPACK routines and MPI_REALTYPE)

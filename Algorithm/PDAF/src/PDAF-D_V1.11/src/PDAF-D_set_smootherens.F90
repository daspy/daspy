! !ROUTINE: PDAF_set_smootherens --- Set pointer to smoother ensemble
SUBROUTINE PDAF_set_smootherens(sens_point, maxlag, status)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Routine to set the pointer to the PDAF-internal smoother ensemble array
! and to set the value of the maximum lah to be considered.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2012-05 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
!
! !USES:
! Include definitions for real type of different precision
! (Defines BLAS/LAPACK routines and MPI_REALTYPE)
#include "typedefs.h"

! !ARGUMENTS:
  REAL, POINTER, INTENT(out) :: sens_point(:,:,:)  ! Pointer to smoother array
  INTEGER, INTENT(in)        :: maxlag  ! Number of past timesteps in sens
  INTEGER, INTENT(out)       :: status  ! Status flag, 
                                        ! 0: no error, 1: maxlag too large

! !CALLING SEQUENCE:
! Called by: PDAF ensemble initialization routine

! !ROUTINE: PDAF_local_weights --- Compute weight functions for localization
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_local_weights(wtype, cradius, sradius, dim, distance, &
     weight, verbose)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! This routine initializates a vector hold weight coefficients
! for localization. The weights can be applied to localization
! on the state covariance matrix of the observation error 
! covariance matrix.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !
!

  IMPLICIT NONE

! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: wtype          ! Type of weight function
          ! (0): unit weight (=1 up to distance=cradius)
          ! (1): exponential decrease (1/e at distance=sradius; 0 for distance>cradius)
          ! (2): 5th order polynomial (Gaspari&Cohn 1999; 0 for distance>cradius)
  REAL, INTENT(in)    :: cradius        ! Parameter for cut-off
  REAL, INTENT(in)    :: sradius        ! Support radius 
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: dim            ! Size of distance and weight arrays
  REAL, INTENT(in)    :: distance(dim)  ! Array holding distances
  REAL, INTENT(out)   :: weight(dim)    ! Array for weights
  INTEGER, INTENT(in) :: verbose        ! Verbosity flag
  

! *** Local variables ***
  INTEGER :: i   ! Counter
  INTEGER :: verbose_s  ! verbosity flag
  REAL    :: distance_s ! Distance for single observation

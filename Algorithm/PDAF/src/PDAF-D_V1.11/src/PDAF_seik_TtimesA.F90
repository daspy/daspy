! !ROUTINE: PDAF_seik_TtimesA() --- Operate matrix T on some matrix
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_seik_TtimesA(rank, dim_col, A, B)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Operate matrix T on another matrix as
!                 B = T A\\
! \\
! T is a dim_ens x (dim_ens-1) matrix with zero column sums.
! There are two proposed forms of T (ensemble size N):\\
! typeT=0: diag(T)=1-1/N; nondiag(T)=-1/N; 
!          last row= -1/N\\
! typeT=1: diag(T)=1; nondiag(T)=0; last row = -1\\
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and 
!    should not be changed by the user   !
!

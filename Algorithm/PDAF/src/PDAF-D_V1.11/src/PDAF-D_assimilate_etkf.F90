! !ROUTINE: PDAF_assimilate_etkf --- Interface to PDAF for ETKF
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE PDAF_assimilate_etkf(U_collect_state, U_distribute_state, &
     U_init_dim_obs, U_obs_op, U_init_obs, U_prepoststep, U_prodRinvA, &
     U_init_obsvar, U_next_observation, outflag)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! Interface routine called from the model at each time
! step during the forecast of each ensemble state. If
! the time of the next analysis step is reached the
! forecast state is transferred to PDAF and the analysis
! is computed by calling PDAF_put_state_etkf. Subsequently, 
! PDAF_get_state is called to initialize the next forecast
! phase. 
!
! The code is very generic. Basically the only
! filter-specific part are the calls to the
! routines PDAF\_put\_state\_X where the analysis
! is computed and PDAF\_get\_state to initialize the next
! forecast phase. The filter-specific call-back subroutines 
! are specified in the calls to the two core routines.
!
! Variant for ETKF with domain decomposition.
!
! !  This is a core routine of PDAF and
!    should not be changed by the user   !

! !ROUTINE: init_dim_obs_pdaf --- Compute number of observations
!
! !INTERFACE:
SUBROUTINE init_dim_obs_pdaf(step, dim_obs_p)

! !DESCRIPTION:
! User-supplied routine for PDAF.
! Used in the filters: SEEK/SEIK/EnKF/ETKF/ESTKF
!
! The routine is called at the beginning of each
! analysis step.  It has to initialize the size of 
! the observation vector according to the current 
! time step for the PE-local domain.
!
! The routine is called by all filter processes.
!
! For the domain-decomposed dummy model, the full
! model state is observed. Thus, the number of
! observations equals the PE-local state dimension.
!
! !REVISION HISTORY:
! 2004-10 - Lars Nerger - Initial code
! Later revisions - see svn log
!
! !USES:
  USE mod_model, &
       ONLY: local_dims
  USE mod_assimilation, &
       ONLY: dim_obs
  USE mod_parallel, &
       ONLY: mype_filter

  IMPLICIT NONE

! !ARGUMENTS:
  INTEGER, INTENT(in)  :: step       ! Current time step
  INTEGER, INTENT(out) :: dim_obs_p  ! Dimension of observation vector

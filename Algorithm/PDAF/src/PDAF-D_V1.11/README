Introduction ---------------------------------------------------------

PDAF is a framework for data assimilation. It provides a parallel
infrastructure, using MPI, to implement a parallel data assimilation
system based on existing numerical models (typically of components of
the earth system). In addition, PDAF provides a selection of
sequential data assimilation algorithms based on the Kalman
filter.

Namely the filter algorithms are:
- SEEK (Singular "Evolutive" Extended Kalman) filter
       [D.-T. Pham et al., J. Mar. Syst. 16 (1998) 323-340] 
- EnKF (The classical perturbed-observations Ensemble Kalman filter)
       [G. Evensen, J. Geophys. Res. 99 C5 (1994) 10143-10162,
        G. Burgers et al., Mon. Wea. Rev. 126 (1998) 1719-1724]
- ESTKF (Error Subspace Transform Kalman filter)
       [L. Nerger et al. Mon. Wea. Rev. 140 (2012) 2335-2345, doi:10.1175/MWR-D-11-00102.1]
- ETKF (Ensemble Transform Kalman filter)
       [C. H. Bishop et al. Mon. Wea. Rev. 129 (2001) 420-436]
       The implementation in PDAF follows that described for the LETKF,
       but as a global filter. 
- SEIK (Singular "Evolutive" Interpolated Kalman) filter
       This is the full ensemble variant of the SEIK (Singular
       "Interpolated" Extended Kalman) filter.
       [SEIK: D.-T. Pham et al., C. R. Acad Sci., Ser. III, 326 (1009)
        255-260, for the SEIK variant in PDAF see L. Nerger et al.,
        Tellus 57A (2005) 715-735]	
- LESTKF (Local Error Subspace Transform Kalman filter)
       [L. Nerger et al. Mon. Wea. Rev. 140 (2012) 2335-2345, doi:10.1175/MWR-D-11-00102.1]
- LETKF (Local Ensemble Transform Kalman filter)
       [B. R. Hunt et al., Physica D 230 (2007) 112-126]
- LSEIK (Local Singular "Evolutive" Interpolated Kalman) filter
       [L. Nerger et al., Oce. Dyn. 56 (2006) 634-649]

All filter algorithms are fully parallelized and optimized. 

Smoother extensions are included for the filters ESTKF/LESTKF, ETKF/LETKF, EnKF.

PDAF is written in Fortran 90. The compilation and execution has been
tested on the following systems:
- AIX
- Linux
- Super-UX
- MacOS X
- IRIX
- Solaris
- Cray CLE


Installation ---------------------------------------------------------

In order to build the PDAF library you need a Fortran 90 compiler and
'make'.

1. Choose a suitable include file for the make process and/or edit
one. In the directory make.arch/ several include files are provided.
There are include files for compilation with and without MPI.

Note: PDAF is generally intended for parallel computing using
MPI. However, it can be compiled for serial computing. To compile PDAF
for this case, a simplified MPI header file is included und should be
in the include path. In addition, a dummy implementation of MPI, which
behaves like MPI in the single-process case, is provided in the
directory nullmpi/. For the serial case, this file should also be
compiled and linked when PDAF is linked to a program.

2. Set the environment variable $PDAF_ARCH to the name of the include
file (without ending .h)

3. cd into the directory src/ and type 'make' at the prompt. This will
compile the sources and generate a library file in the directory lib/


Test suite -----------------------------------------------------------

A set of example implementations is provided in the directory testsuite/:
- dummymodel_1D
  This is here the example implementation in which PDAF is fully
  connected to a model. The model is trivial: At each time step simply
  the time step size is added to the state vector.
- offline_1D
  This example shows the usage of PDAF as an offline tool. In the offline
  configuration one computes manually the ensemble integrations and
  supplies this information to PDAF through files. This example does not
  use files, but generates dummy-information in the code.
- lorenz63
  This directory currently only contains the forward Lorenz-63 model. It
  can serve as a basis for test-implemetnatin using PDAF.
- lorenz96
  This directory currently only contains the forward Lorenz-96 model.
  This model can be configured to have a sufficiently large state
  dimension to test low-rank filter algorithms.

1. To build the examples follow steps 1 and 2 from above. Subsequently
cd to testsuite/src. 

2. executing 'make' will show you the possible options for building.

The executable will be available in the directory testsuite/bin/ after
bulding. You don't need to build the PDAF library manually as
described before. This is also part of the compile process for the
example cases of the test suite.

The test cases can also be run as pure forward models. For the, one
has to removed the preprocessor definition 'USE_PDAF' from the include
file for the make process.


Verifying your installation ------------------------------------------

The directory testsuite/tests_dummy1D contains files that can be
used to verify an installation of PDAF.

In particular the directory contains scripts to execute the online
case dummymodel_1D and the offline test test offline_1D. Scripts
for serial (non-parallel) execution as well as example scripts for
running parallel test jobs on an IBM-AIX computer using a batch
systems are provided.

In addition outputs of the test cases are provided for different
computers and compilers.

An installation of PDAF can be veryfied using the test suite as follows:
1. prepare the include file in make.arch
2. cd to testsuite/src
3. Build and execute the online experiments:
   'make pdaf_dummy_online' and 'make test_pdaf_online > out_online.txt'
4. Build and execute the offline experiments:
   'make pdaf_dummy_online' and 'make test_pdaf_offline > out_offline.txt'
6. Check the files out_online.txt and out_offline.txt for error messages.
   You can also diff the files to corresponding files in one of the
   example-directories in ../tests_dummy1D.
7. Compare the output files in ../bin, like output_seik0.dat, with
   corresponding files the example-directories in ../tests_dummy1D.


Tutorial  --------------------------------------------------

The directory /tutorial contains files for a tutorial demonstrating the 
implementation of an offline analysis step with a simple 2-dimensional
example as well as examples for an online implementation with a serial
(non-parallelized) as well as a parallel model. The web site of PDAF
holds the corresponding slide sets in PDF format.
